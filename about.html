        <p>
          Lip blush is a semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing treatment designed to enhance the natural color, shape, and definition of the lips. This procedure creates a soft, tinted look—similar to a lip tint or balm—that gives the lips a more youthful and symmetrical appearance.

          Before the procedure begins, a numbing cream is applied to the lips to minimize discomfort. Once the area is partially numb, pigment is carefully deposited into the top layer of the skin using a fine needle. The process is precise and customizable, ensuring a natural finish that complements your features.

          Prior to your treatment, you will complete a consultation form to assess your suitability based on any contraindications. If no contraindications are present, a patch test will be provided to ensure safety. After successful test results, we’ll proceed with the treatment. During the session, we will analyze your skin type, preferred shapes, and tone using the Fitzpatrick scale to determine the perfect pigment.

Located in Watford, Hertfordshire, our studio provides a relaxing environment where sessions last approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the treatment area. Each procedure includes precise measurements and pre-drawing for symmetry and accuracy. A numbing agent is applied to ensure comfort, and the results are tailored to enhance your natural features.

Post-treatment, a healing period of 4-6 weeks allows the pigment to settle. During this time, any necessary touch-ups can refine the results. With proper care, semi-permanent makeup offers a smudge-free, time-saving solution lasting 1-3 years, empowering you with a polished, confident look
